                <p><strong>Will you stay by Norhafsah Hamid</strong></p>
                <p> Rate: 6/10 </p>
                <p> Reviews: Norhafsah Hamid's Will You Stay? is a heartwarming, faith-infused romance centered on Amy, a young, ambitious surgeon-in-training, and Rasyid, a kind lawyer and hafiz.

                <p> Reviews: Misteri Patung Garam is a visceral, dark thriller that blends forensic science with biblical symbolism. Set in Surabaya, it follows Inspector Kiri Lamari as he hunts a serial killer who transforms victims into grotesque "salt statues"—surgically altered, posed, and encrusted in salt.</p> 

                <p> This book have a unique concept that insipered by the story of Lot's wife, the salt motif creates a hauntingly poetic atmosphere. It also have noir vibe by making it feels like a cross between Hannibal and classic detective noir. The balance between graphic gore, the book is grounded by witty dialogue and deep psychological themes of trauma and "looking back" at the past.</p>
